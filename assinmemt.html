            <h2>Backend Technologies</h2>

            <p>
                Server-Side Technologies: Server-side technologies include
                programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js,
                which are used for server-side scripting and processing.
                Frameworks and platforms built with these languages facilitate
                the development of web applications and handle server-side logic
                and data management. Database Technologies: Databases are
                essential for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data
                in web applications. Technologies like MySQL, PostgreSQL,
                MongoDB, and Oracle provide database management systems that
                integrate with web applications.

            <p>
                API: enables different software applications to interact and
                exchange data with each other. JSON: is a lightweight data
                interchange format commonly used for <em>transmitting</em> data
                between a web server and a web application. XML: is another
                markup language used for structuring and storing data in a
                hierarchical format. It is commonly used for representing and
                exchanging structured data between different systems.

            <h2>Frontend Technologies</h2>

            <p>
                HTML: is the standard markup language for creating the structure
                and content of web pages. It defines the elements and tags that
                specify how content is organized and presented on a web page.
                CSS: controls the visual appearance and layout of HTML elements
                on a web page. It enables the separation of design and content,
                allowing developers to apply styles, such as colors, fonts,
                spacing, and positioning, to HTML elements. JS: is a programming
                language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web
                pages. It allows developers to manipulate HTML elements, handle
                events, create animations, and interact with web APIs.
